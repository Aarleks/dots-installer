# Dotfiles for My MacOs and Arch Systems

This repo contains the dotfiles for my MacOS and Arch Linux systems. These dotfiles are built/iterated from and shamelessly ripped from a bunch of sources, many of which I can't remember. But I can definitely thank ![Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) and Luke Smith for his [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz) project. If you're new to Arch and are looking for a tiling WM, vim-based system, you should check LARBS out.

#### Installer Notes
To be run from a clean Arch installation.


## Included Programs

### i3 + Polybar (or i3Blocks?)
Tiling windows FTW

### URXVT or ST
I prefer ST but haven't got it humming yet. In the meantime, URXVT will be used.

### Vim
My .vimrc (and _vimrc) for academic writing, blogging, and some R work.

### R + RStudio
Even though I love Vim, RStudio is my goto for R projects.

### Scripts
To make commandline life easier and way cooler.
